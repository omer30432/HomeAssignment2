          <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          <p>
            As a third-year student of Industrial Engineering and Management, my
            journey is further enriched by a robust athletic background, which
            has cultivated a myriad of skills essential for both academic and
            professional success. This unique blend of experiences has imbued me
            with an unwavering drive, effective management capabilities, and a
            collaborative spirit that thrives in team settings.
          </p>
          <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
          <p>
            As a dedicated athlete, I have had the privilege of playing
            professional basketball since 2016, currently representing Hapoel
            Ramat Gan Givatayim in the third division. From 2014 to 2018, I had
            the honor of representing my country as a member of the Israeli
            Basketball National Youth Team. From 2018 to 2021, I managed and
            coached basketball teams at the Maccabi Hadera Basketball Club.
          </p>
          <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
          <p>
            Since 2021, I've been studying Industrial Engineering and Management
            at Ruppin Academic Center, expanding my knowledge and skills. My
            curiosity about finance led me to complete a Capital Market and
            Stock Exchange Trading Course at Psagot College in 2020. I'm not
            just passionate about academics; basketball has been a significant
            part of my life. In 2018, I took a Basketball Coaching Course at
            Lewinsky-Wingate College to understand the game from a coaching
            perspective. My journey started at the Wingate Institute
            (2013-2016), where I balanced high school with intensive basketball
            training at their Basketball Academy. These experiences have taught
            me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of pursuing excellence.
          </p>
          <h2>MILITARY SERVICE</h2>
          <p>
            From 2016 to 2018, I served in the military, where I was recognized
            as an outstanding athlete. During this time, I played for the
            Israeli national basketball team, participating in European
            championships and international tournaments, and even played
            professionally in the second league. Alongside my sports
            achievements, I played a crucial role in the Logistics Unit. There,
            I was in charge of managing supply warehouses, juggling various
            tasks, and collaborating closely with military officials. This
            period was not only about showcasing my skills on the basketball
            court but also about contributing significantly to the logistical
            operations of the military.
