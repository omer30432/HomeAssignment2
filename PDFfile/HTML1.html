 <p> Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. <br>
 Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.<br>
 The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement,[definition needed] with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<br>
 The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. 
 Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. <br>
 These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. <br>
 It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished.<br>
 This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars.<br>
 The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.<br> </p>

  <div style="font-family:tahoma; ">
  <p> Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. <br>
  It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833. <br>
  Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.  <br>
 Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square.<br>
  Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games.<br>
The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875. Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.<br>
 In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC).<br>
 Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.<br>
 He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee.
 This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris.<br>
 On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.<br>
 The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.<br> </p>

<center> <h2 style="color :#ff003e; font-family:tahoma"> The Evolution Of Olympic Culture (And Some Politics) </H2> </CENTER> <br>
  <div style="font-family:tahoma; ">
  The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games.<br>
  Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, <br>
  the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific),<br>
  and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics.<br>
  The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements.<br>
  The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin,<br>
  to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate<br>
  sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War<br>
  limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games.<br>
 As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter.<br>
 The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols,<br>
 such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined,<br>
 in 35 different sports and over 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<br>
The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented; colonies and overseas territories are allowed to field their own teams.<br>
 This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism.<br>
 Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame.<br>
 The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<br> </p>

 <h3 style="color :blue; font-family:tahoma">  Michel Phelps: </h3> <br>  
  <div style="font-family:tahoma; ">
 <p> Michael Fred Phelps II (born June 30, 1985) is an American former competitive swimmer. <br>
 He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time with a total of 28 medals. Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals, <br>
 Olympic gold medals in individual events, and Olympic medals in individual events. When Phelps won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games,<br>
 he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens,<br>
 Phelps already tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games by winning six gold and two bronze medals. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London,<br>
 Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. <br>
 This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.<br> </p>

<h3 style="color :blue; font-family:tahoma"> Usain bolt: </h3> <br>
 <div style="font-family:tahoma; ">
 <p> Usain St. Leo Bolt( born 21 August 1986) is a retired Jamaican sprinter, widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time.<br>

An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016).<br>
 He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics,<br>
 which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory.<br>
An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, <br>
with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011. He is the most successful male athlete of the World Championships.<br>
 Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200 m and is one of the most successful in the 100 m with three titles.<br>
Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing.<br>
 He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 × 100 metres relay world records, <br>
 with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles.<br>
 The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals (including 2007 World Championship silver) and held the world under-20<br>
 and world under-18 records for the event until being surpassed by Erriyon Knighton in 2021. <br>
